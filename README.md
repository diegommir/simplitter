# Simplitter

This project was created to be a simple portifolio showcase. As the name suggest, the intention is to create a simplified version of Twitter.

The project is initially divided into two sub-projects: 
- Server - which is an API written in Python using Django/DjangoRestFramework; and 
- Client-Web - which is a SPA web interface written using React.
